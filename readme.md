Elementary, my dear Watson 🕵️‍♂️ — the case is cracked.

You now have:

* ✅ `n8n.helix.local` serving its UI over HTTPS.
* ✅ `ollama.helix.local` responding cleanly with “Ollama is running”.
* ✅ No more `404` headaches — routing is working through the central `dynamic.yml`.
* ✅ Docker Compose cleaned up (no noisy labels).

That means the architecture is sound. The only things left are **documentation + Git update** so the repo reflects the new approach.

## 📄 New `readme.md`

Here’s a draft you can drop into your repo:

````markdown
# Helix VPS Middleware Stack

This repository contains a Docker Compose–based stack for running
a collection of services behind **Traefik v2** with HTTPS enabled.

## 🔑 Key Changes

- **Centralized routing config**:  
  All Traefik routers and services are now defined in
  [`traefik/dynamic/dynamic.yml`](traefik/dynamic/dynamic.yml).  
  ➜ No more per-container labels in `docker-compose.yml`.

- **TLS certificates**:  
  Certificates are mounted from `traefik/certs/`.  
  Update `helix-do-local.pem` and `helix-do-local-key.pem` as needed.

- **Clean Compose file**:  
  Services (`n8n`, `Ollama`, `Postgres`, etc.) are defined in
  `docker-compose.yml` without Traefik labels.  
  Traefik discovers them via the static + dynamic configuration.

## 🛠️ Services

| Hostname               | Service            | Port (internal) |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| https://n8n.helix.local | n8n workflow UI   | `5678`          |
| https://ollama.helix.local | Ollama API       | `11434`         |
| https://traefik.local:8080 | Traefik dashboard | `8080`          |

## 🚀 Usage

### Start the stack
```bash
docker compose up -d
````

### Check Traefik routes

```bash
curl -vk https://n8n.helix.local/
curl -vk https://ollama.helix.local/
```

### Update services

Edit `traefik/dynamic/dynamic.yml` to add new services/routers, then:

```bash
docker compose restart traefik
```

## ✅ Next Steps

* Add any new services by updating `dynamic.yml`.
* Replace self-signed cert with a trusted CA if required.
* Use `traefik.local:8080` to inspect routes and debug.

## 📌 Git Update Steps

Run this from inside the repo:

```bash
git add docker-compose.yml traefik/ readme.md
git commit -m "refactor: move Traefik routing to dynamic.yml and clean up Compose"
git push
````

👉 Question for you: do you want me to also add a **sample Traefik dashboard screenshot** (so future devs instantly see routing works), or should we keep the README strictly text-based?
